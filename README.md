# thesis-testing-martingale-hyothesis
We implement different martingale tests in R. We analyse the size and power performance of all tests by performing simulation studies. We apply the tests on daily exchange rates relative to the US dollar.

This R-code is part of my master's thesis for the degree of Master of Science in Statistics. It was submitted to Humboldt-University of Berlin, School of Business and Economics, Institute of Statistics and Econometrics.
